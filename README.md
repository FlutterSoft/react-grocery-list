# React Grocery List
A React project that allows you to add grocery items, change category of items, filter items by category, and remove items.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Javascript, CSS, Local Storage.

## Optimizations

My design is definitely not good so a redesign with the CSS would be a good start. Adding back-end functionality to save your lists online would be good as it is currently stored in local storage only.

## Lessons Learned:

A lot about React! Using state, learning about passing props/state. Realising how important it is to have components broken down into parts that actually make sense as a whole. I also learnt how messy it gets passing down props many levels. How to use local storage as well.
